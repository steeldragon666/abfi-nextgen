Wondering how we verify suppliers? Every supplier on ABFI undergoes rigorous checks. 
We validate their ABN, GST registration, and Sustainability Certification. 
We also monitor their performance metrics and customer reviews. 
Look for the green verified badge - it means they've passed all our checks. 
You can also filter suppliers by location, capacity, and certification type.
